# Kanban — Cosmogonic Quantum Mechalogodrom

The delivery board for the project. It tracks work as cards moving left→right
across columns, grouped by **epic (era)**. The eras map 1:1 to the binding
contract sections in [MODULE-CONTRACTS.md](./MODULE-CONTRACTS.md) and to the
tagged releases in [../CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md). Every "Done" card landed
behind the full gate (`bun run check`) and a commit.

> **How to read this:** a card is `[id] title — one-line outcome`. The legend
> below defines status and priority. WIP limits keep focus: at most a handful of
> cards are ever **In Progress** at once. New work enters at **Backlog**, is
> pulled to **Next** when scoped, **In Progress** when started, **Review** when
> the gate runs, and **Done** when committed.

| ----------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------- |

| Next        | 4     | Scoped; pull as WIP frees                       |
| In Progress | 2     | Within the WIP limit of 3                       |
| Review      | 0     |                                                 |
| Done        | 30+   | Every card gated + committed + (per era) tagged |

**Definition of Done:** code + tests + JSDoc/complexity note; `bun run check`
green (prettier → tsc strict → oxlint → bun test → build); a conventional commit;
docs updated (CHANGELOG + any affected contract/diagram). Determinism preserved
(same seed → same cosmos) and per-frame hot paths allocation-free.
