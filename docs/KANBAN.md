# Kanban — Cosmogonic Quantum Mechalogodrom

The delivery board for the project. It tracks work as cards moving left→right
across columns, grouped by **epic (era)**. The eras map 1:1 to the binding
contract sections in [MODULE-CONTRACTS.md](./MODULE-CONTRACTS.md) and to the
tagged releases in [../CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md). Every "Done" card landed
behind the full gate (`bun run check`) and a commit.

> **How to read this:** a card is `[id] title — one-line outcome`. The legend
> below defines status and priority. WIP limits keep focus: at most a handful of
> cards are ever **In Progress** at once. New work enters at **Backlog**, is
> pulled to **Next** when scoped, **In Progress** when started, **Review** when
> the gate runs, and **Done** when committed.

- 🟧 P1 `V13-ECONOMY` — 2 competing currencies (AURUM ☉/UMBRA ☾) + 2 commodities (QUANTA ◇/ICHOR ❖): clearing market + currency-adoption game, titan/NHI wallets, own `econRng` sub-stream (determinism intact) — _237710c, +9 tests_
- 🟧 P1 `V13-HUD` — bottom-right View/Speed/Render box (non-overlapping) + NHI telemetry tally — _1cfe189_
- 🟧 P1 `NATIVE-ENGINE` — C++20/OpenGL SDF ray-marcher, GLFW+GLM, MinGW GCC 16.1, rendered on RTX 5070 Ti; unified amber jewel plate — _17fa52f, 1178c0f_
- 🟥 P0 `NATIVE-PHYSICS` — **LIVE** impulse rigid-body solver (gravity well, sphere collisions + restitution + friction-spin, quaternion tumbling), active by default, drives the render — _6f5daa9_
- 🟨 P2 `DOCS-V13` — ADR-0007, ENTITY-SHEETS, ERD economy/physics, this board
- 🟧 P1 `CREATURES-100` — 100 Shoggoths + 100 Puppeteers (desktop+; lights capped → shader-safe; lesser puppeteers deterministic, no rng). Verified 100/100 at `?tier=ultra`, glErr 0
- 🟨 P2 `TIER-OVERRIDE` — `?tier=` boot override for QA across the quality ladder
- 🟨 P2 `NATIVE-4K` — true 3840×2160 reliquary plate rendered (native, live physics, RTX 5070 Ti)
- 🟧 P1 `NHI-OBSERVATORY` — per-NHI 9-view 3×3 connectome grid (firing · topology · memory · reward · sensory · intention · affect · prediction · decision), live + scientific, each bound to real `NhiMind` state. Verified: 3 NHIs, all 9 views painting
- 🟧 P1 `TITAN-DIPLO-ECON` — AURUM/UMBRA wealth steers titan PD diplomacy (richer → raid → war, poorer → appease); null-safe `attachEconomy`, goldens byte-identical. Verified live: 21 ally / 24 war / 0 truce under a live Gini
- 🟧 P1 `SHOG-ECON-BEHAVIOR` — 100 Shoggoths enrolled (varied purses); wealth drives boldness (hunt cadence, tendril tug, body size+glow), relative to live mean. Verified: 210→500 spread, ~31 bold / ~32 timid
- 🟥 P0 `JOLT-ON` — Jolt Physics 5.2 wired ON by default in the native engine (`physics_jolt.h`): specimens are real rigid bodies (mass/inertia/restitution), central well + case spring, broad/narrow-phase solve. Built w/ MinGW, verified on RTX 5070 Ti
- 🟧 P1 `PUP-ECON-BEHAVIOR` — 100 Puppeteers enrolled (varied purses); wealth drives meddle cadence + body size/glow, relative to live mean. Market now 210 agents. Verified: 181→435 spread, ~32 bold / ~32 timid
- 🟧 P1 `ECON-MARKET-MECHANICS` — cartel (supply withholding), arbitrage (price-gap mean-reversion), sanctions (`economy.sanction`; titan wars → embargo). New telemetry cartelShare/arbSpread/sanctioned. +4 tests. Verified live
- 🟧 P1 `ECON-BLACK-MARKET` — embargoed buy off-book at a 25% smuggler premium, everyone else smuggles; second clearing pass, `blackVolume` telemetry. Verified live ~115 units/tick under the titan war-sanctions
- 🟧 P1 `ECON-AUCTIONS` — second-price (Vickrey/English) windfall auctions of the scarcer commodity; commons-dividend redistribution; `vickreyOutcome` helper + auctions/lastAuctionPrice telemetry. +2 tests, verified live (QUANTA lot @ ~27)
- 🟧 P1 `ECON-MARKET-TICKER` — self-building ⊙ MARKET panel surfacing all 11 economy telemetry (reserve money, FX, prices, arb, Gini, wealth, agents, cartel, sanctioned, black market, auctions) + FX/price sparkline. Verified live, all populated

- 🟧 P1 `SHOG-COGNITION` — Shoggoths perceive (prey + rival crowding + singularity), remember (satiation EMA), flee the crowd, hunt the calm, agitate under threat. Pure `creatureDrive` kernel + 4 tests. Verified live (satiation diverges, perf steady)
- 🟧 P1 `PUP-COGNITION` — Puppeteers reuse the kernel as SCHEMERS (no flee): perceive sector disorder, remember meddling, meddle MORE opportunistically over target-rich chaos. Verified live (satiation diverges, 90 mutations fired)
- 🟧 P1 `CREATURE-DECEIVE` — kernel `deceive` drive: outmatched shoggoths feign weakness (dim glow + eyes, shrink, soften tendrils). Threat radius widened so social sense engages. Verified: 63/100 sense rivals
- 🟥 P0 `MATERIAL-CLASSES` — 6 per-silhouette material archetypes (pearl/crystal/glass/amber/metal/bone) baked as compile-time `#define RQ_MAT` in the Reliquary shader; each tunes relief/roughness/metalness/SSS/film. `materialClassFor(gi)`. Verified live (all 6 compile, distinct materials render)
- 🟥 P0 `JOLT-FRACTURE` (V28) — native specimens shatter on hard impact: the hardest contact each step cracks the smaller body into **3 volume-conserving Jolt shards** (∛⅓ radius, own mass/inertia) bursting along the impact normal. **Pre-solve** approach-velocity gate @ 1.6 u/s (≈70% of the measured 2.24 u/s infall peak); shards <0.42u inert, growth capped at 48 (shader `MAX_BODIES` 24→48). Deterministic — verified 18→24 bodies, identical ×2
- 🟥 P0 `CREATURE-TRADE` (V29) — Shoggoths **bargain, trade & ally**: kernel gains `trade` (deal with the UNLIKE → worth to the wealthier, widens spread) + `ally` (peer coalition under threat → worth to the poorer, narrows it). Economy gains conservation-exact `transferWorth`; `attachTrade` facade closes the cognition→wealth→boldness loop. +5 tests. **Verified live: 440 deals / 673 AURUM over 600 frames — 103 bargains + 337 alliances, Gini 0.138→0.125**
- 🟥 P0 `AI-REPAIR` (V30) — Copilot **diagnostics + recovery pipeline**: `/api/copilot/health` live-probes the whole failover chain (parallel 1-token ping, 6s timeout); the 🩺 panel shows per-provider health lights (● up / ○ down + reason: ok/rate-limited/auth/timeout), the verdict, and a ↻ Re-probe/restart that re-enables the input on recovery. Pure `classifyHealth`/`healthVerdict` +7 tests. **Verified live: 2/2 key-less providers UP → operational**
- 🟥 P0 `SUPER-CREATURE-MIND` (V31) — the always-active apex being: **½ Titan, ~100× power**, a genuine **1444-param deep mind** (stacked CORTEX→ACTOR 18→32→16→12→8) with emotion EMA (valence/arousal/dominance), episodic memory, a prediction loop (→SURPRISE), GOAP planning (HUNT/FLEE/DOMINATE/DECEIVE/SPAWN/EXPLORE/REST), and ≤3 mutated twins. Apex purse (weight 20); self-mounting **⬢ ARCHITECT** telemetry panel (no overlap, 32px gap). Own rng sub-stream → golden intact. +5 tests. **Verified live: `ARCHITECT-Ω`, plan DOMINATE, dominance 0.998, wallet 2.1k, panel populated, 0 console errors, 736 tests green**
- 🟥 P0 `SUPER-CREATURE-BODY` (V32) — the **graphics emphasis**: a masterful many-eyed apex BODY (`sim/super-body.ts`) — faceted crystalline CORE + wireframe ARCHITECTURE cage + 16 glowing EYES + 11 radial SPIKE-ARMS + 3 orbiting CHROME RINGS, from the 5 visual-DNA plates. Hand-written **god-jewel shader** (patched MeshStandardMaterial): fBm crystalline relief + thin-film iridescence + Fresnel + subsurface GOD-GLOW in the live plan colour × dominance. Animation wholly cognition-driven (spin/heartbeat∝arousal, glow∝dominance, colour=plan, arm-splay∝aggression, morph∝surprise). **Verified live via `__CQM__` capture: violet many-eyed spiked orb haloed by chrome rings (plan DOMINATE→violet), shader compiled clean, 0 console errors, 737 tests green**

### 🚧 Next — SUPER CREATURE + chaos-biome directive (user, 2026-06-14)

- 🟥 P0 `SUPER-CREATURE-POLISH` — past V32 (body shipped): push the look further — selective **bloom** on the god-glow + eyes, sharper crystalline facets, stronger thin-film, blink/saccade on the eyes, quantum teleport-flourish; tune eye colour (currently blazes white at high dominance). The "endlessly refine" loop.
- 🟧 P1 `SUPER-CREATURE-SENSES` — wire the percept from REAL world queries (nearest prey/rival via the grid, singularity pull, true vision/sound) instead of the current chaos/population proxies; let its `move`/dominance act back on the world (manipulate lesser entities).
- 🟧 P1 `ACCESS-PUZZLE` — the cryptographic GUI puzzle (seed 3455456754, "only the Romans know", Roman-numeral line-count logic ≤ X; scrambled/shimmering, retry 5s, ACCESS DENIED in 100 rotating languages) gating the **2nd super creature**.
- 🟧 P1 `SUPERHERO-MODE` — solving the puzzle unlocks player-as-creature: controls, vision modes, life/energy bars, stats, inventory, wallet, neural state, powers, camera, progression.
- 🟦 P3 `CHAOS-BIOME-50K` — scale toward 50,000 entities · 100 archetypes (edge-geometry silhouettes, mutating morphology), each a 50–150-param neural controller; LOD/instancing/batching/spatial-partition budget work.
- 🟦 P3 `AI-WEB-HELP` — in-world AI web search + repo-grounded RAG ("Explain this / What is that?"), a HELP ME NOW control by SPECS/DOCS/LAB, under a safety constitution.
- 🟦 P3 `RAG-BOOK` — the massively-organized human/AI repo book (file maps, module/data-flow, AI/RAG notes, build/run, troubleshooting, roadmap).
- 🟦 P3 `UI-ERGONOMICS` — move the Sorting Count/Step meter clock off the Sorting Fields dropdown; keep Sorting Fields draggable; de-overlap NEURAL/SPECS/DOCS into the bottom-center bar; typography/spacing pass.

### 🚧 Next — V13/V14 directive backlog (user, 2026-06-14)

- 🟧 P1 `ECON-PROXY-WARS` — explicit patron→proxy funding + trade blocs (titan wealth now tilts PD diplomacy → war/alliance; explicit bloc mechanics next)
- 🟦 P3 `ECON-TRIBE-WALLETS` — give graph-tribes collective wallets + coalition treasuries (the full market-mechanic list — cartel/arbitrage/sanctions/black-market/auctions — shipped V20–V22)
- 🟩 P2 `CREATURES-SMART` — Shoggoths now perceive/remember/flee/hunt (V24) + deceive (V26) + **bargain/trade/ally (V29)**; Puppeteers scheme (V25). Remaining verbs: **mutate** (cognition-driven), and trade/ally for the Puppeteer cabal
- 🟦 P3 `AI-AUTOKEY` — past V30 diagnostics (shipped): optional auto-provision of a keyed provider (Groq/Cerebras) to fail over to when the key-less pool is rate-limited, for higher chat reliability
- 🟦 P3 `JOLT-SOFTBODY` — past V18 (Jolt ON) + V28 (rigid fracture): soft-body deformation + crowd-scale (100s of native bodies); bring the native target into CI; render true 4K (3840×2160) plates from the Jolt sim
