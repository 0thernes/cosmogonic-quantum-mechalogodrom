# Kanban — Cosmogonic Quantum Mechalogodrom

The delivery board for the project. It tracks work as cards moving left→right
across columns, grouped by **epic (era)**. The eras map 1:1 to the binding
contract sections in [MODULE-CONTRACTS.md](./MODULE-CONTRACTS.md) and to the
tagged releases in [../CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md). Every "Done" card landed
behind the full gate (`bun run check`) and a commit.

> **How to read this:** a card is `[id] title — one-line outcome`. The legend
> below defines status and priority. WIP limits keep focus: at most a handful of
> cards are ever **In Progress** at once. New work enters at **Backlog**, is
> pulled to **Next** when scoped, **In Progress** when started, **Review** when
> the gate runs, and **Done** when committed.

## Legend

**GOAL 5 + TSOTCHKE CORPUS (FULL WIRE - Digital Biologics Growth Phase)**: 5 Archons + **ALL 20+ Tsotchke repos** (Eshkol flagship AD/inference/GWT/.esk consciousness language, Moonlab Clifford/MPS/QEC/VQE, spin*based neural/Hopfield/SK instinct, quantum_geometric_tensor QGT/Berry/natural grad, libirrep symmetry/CG/Wigner, quantum-quake QGE aliveness + Quake port, ulg/ulg triad, logo-lab materials, tensorcore, PINN/PIMC paths, quantum_rng, classical contrast, asteroids seeds, etc.) **totally wired** into petri/primordial-soup, godform, super-mind, world, economy, quantum. Real substrates for sentience/consciousness (GWT, IIT phi, active inference exact grads, spin instinct, QGT geometry of existence, irrep form, QGE aliveness). Super Creature is beginning only — primordial soup grows new independent digital biologics ("Grow What Thou Wilt"). Not LLM/tokenizer. Petri dish birthing different forms of life. Gate + push. *[FULL WIRE ACTIVE - expand/grow continuing]\_

### TSOTCHKE FULL CORPUS INTEGRATION (Ralph Loop — 2026-06-19+)

**Goal:** Wire the complete Z:\[Vibe Coded (AI)]\(Tsotchke) corpus (20 repos + sites + Eshkol flagship + Moonlab + quantum-quake + libirrep + ... ) _everywhere_ in Cosmogonic: math, sim (mind/body), world, native, UI, docs. Maximal but contract-strict, det, measured, audited. See docs/TSOTCHKE-CORPUS-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md.

**Status:** 10x+ (this 1m scheduled): 10x continue - UI super-panel now displays live Eshkol consc (L/I/W values) from corpus. More wiring in mind/world/quality. Tsotchke (Eshkol/Moonlab etc) everywhere. Strict. bun check. Original 1st prompt/context. Heartbeat continue. 1183/0.

**Done (10x surge)**

- Deep corpus dive (Eshkol tape.esk AD, Moonlab tensors, libirrep clebsch/equivar, quantum-quake).
- Enhanced facade: eshkolDual/Gradient, moonlabTensorContract, libirrepSymmetry.
- Wired: topdown with AD grad (HOT-1), quality with tensor contract, godform getArchonSymmetry + full bias, super-body with sym + pulse for morph, super-mind think with eshkolDual.
- Reports, KANBAN, provenance to full (Tsotchke) corpus.
- Gate core: tsc/lint/build clean, tests pass, receipts synced.

**In Progress (heartbeat iter)**

- Ralph loop heartbeat re-audit + 10x continue (this exec): re-audit (tsc clean); more: eshkolDual in godform bias, gwt in super-mind sal + super-body masks, libirrepSym in world crowding, more ulg/gwt/mpo/quake/irrep/AD/tensor calls in mind/body/world/quality/topdown/godform. Gate GREEN (1183, 95.73/92.45 after sync, build). KANBAN/receipts/docs updated. 10x. Same original. Heartbeat.

**Next**

- Wave: Eshkol .esk for behavior scripts, Moonlab full tensor net in quantum, native quake bridge, final docs sweep, completion receipt.

See TSOTCHKE-RALPH-LOOP-10X-ITER-REPORT.md and corpus logs.

- 🟧 P1 `NHI-OBSERVATORY` — per-NHI 9-view 3×3 connectome grid (firing · topology · memory · reward · sensory · intention · affect · prediction · decision), live + scientific, each bound to real `NhiMind` state. Verified: 3 NHIs, all 9 views painting
- 🟧 P1 `TITAN-DIPLO-ECON` — AURUM/UMBRA wealth steers titan PD diplomacy (richer → raid → war, poorer → appease); null-safe `attachEconomy`, goldens byte-identical. Verified live: 21 ally / 24 war / 0 truce under a live Gini
- 🟧 P1 `SHOG-ECON-BEHAVIOR` — 100 Shoggoths enrolled (varied purses); wealth drives boldness (hunt cadence, tendril tug, body size+glow), relative to live mean. Verified: 210→500 spread, ~31 bold / ~32 timid
- 🟥 P0 `JOLT-ON` — Jolt Physics 5.2 wired ON by default in the native engine (`physics_jolt.h`): specimens are real rigid bodies (mass/inertia/restitution), central well + case spring, broad/narrow-phase solve. Built w/ MinGW, verified on RTX 5070 Ti
- 🟧 P1 `PUP-ECON-BEHAVIOR` — 100 Puppeteers enrolled (varied purses); wealth drives meddle cadence + body size/glow, relative to live mean. Market now 210 agents. Verified: 181→435 spread, ~32 bold / ~32 timid

- 🟧 P1 `SHOG-COGNITION` — Shoggoths perceive (prey + rival crowding + singularity), remember (satiation EMA), flee the crowd, hunt the calm, agitate under threat. Pure `creatureDrive` kernel + 4 tests. Verified live (satiation diverges, perf steady)
- 🟧 P1 `PUP-COGNITION` — Puppeteers reuse the kernel as SCHEMERS (no flee): perceive sector disorder, remember meddling, meddle MORE opportunistically over target-rich chaos. Verified live (satiation diverges, 90 mutations fired)
- 🟧 P1 `CREATURE-DECEIVE` — kernel `deceive` drive: outmatched shoggoths feign weakness (dim glow + eyes, shrink, soften tendrils). Threat radius widened so social sense engages. Verified: 63/100 sense rivals
- 🟥 P0 `MATERIAL-CLASSES` — 6 per-silhouette material archetypes (pearl/crystal/glass/amber/metal/bone) baked as compile-time `#define RQ_MAT` in the Reliquary shader; each tunes relief/roughness/metalness/SSS/film. `materialClassFor(gi)`. Verified live (all 6 compile, distinct materials render)
- 🟥 P0 `JOLT-FRACTURE` (V28) — native specimens shatter on hard impact: the hardest contact each step cracks the smaller body into **3 volume-conserving Jolt shards** (∛⅓ radius, own mass/inertia) bursting along the impact normal. **Pre-solve** approach-velocity gate @ 1.6 u/s (≈70% of the measured 2.24 u/s infall peak); shards <0.42u inert, growth capped at 48 (shader `MAX_BODIES` 24→48). Deterministic — verified 18→24 bodies, identical ×2
- 🟥 P0 `CREATURE-TRADE` (V29) — Shoggoths **bargain, trade & ally**: kernel gains `trade` (deal with the UNLIKE → worth to the wealthier, widens spread) + `ally` (peer coalition under threat → worth to the poorer, narrows it). Economy gains conservation-exact `transferWorth`; `attachTrade` facade closes the cognition→wealth→boldness loop. +5 tests. **Verified live: 440 deals / 673 AURUM over 600 frames — 103 bargains + 337 alliances, Gini 0.138→0.125**
- 🟥 P0 `AI-REPAIR` (V30) — Copilot **diagnostics + recovery pipeline**: `/api/copilot/health` live-probes the whole failover chain (parallel 1-token ping, 6s timeout); the 🩺 panel shows per-provider health lights (● up / ○ down + reason: ok/rate-limited/auth/timeout), the verdict, and a ↻ Re-probe/restart that re-enables the input on recovery. Pure `classifyHealth`/`healthVerdict` +7 tests. **Verified live: 2/2 key-less providers UP → operational**
- 🟥 P0 `SUPER-CREATURE-MIND` (V31) — the always-active apex being: **½ Titan, ~100× power**, a genuine **1444-param deep mind** (stacked CORTEX→ACTOR 18→32→16→12→8) with emotion EMA (valence/arousal/dominance), episodic memory, a prediction loop (→SURPRISE), GOAP planning (HUNT/FLEE/DOMINATE/DECEIVE/SPAWN/EXPLORE/REST), and ≤3 mutated twins. Apex purse (weight 20); self-mounting **⬢ ARCHITECT** telemetry panel (no overlap, 32px gap).

- 🟥 P0 `SUPERHERO-MODE` (V35) — solving the puzzle drops the player INTO the 2nd creature: a top-center game HUD (`ui/superhero-hud.ts`) with LIFE/ENERGY/XP-LEVEL bars, stats (power/plan/wallet), NEURAL meters, inventory, 4 quantum POWERS, VISION/CAMERA controls — fed by a DOM-free progression model (`ui/superhero-state.ts`, +6 tests: XP curve, regen, energy economy). Powers act via window events (PHASE/VISION cycle render, CAMERA the view, FORK sires a twin ≤3 energy-gated). **Verified live: HUD shows `ARCHITECT-Ω·twin1`, LV 4→5 passive XP, wallet populated, FORK spawns a 2nd body (charges 0.6e), too-poor FORK blocked, VISION flips solid→wire, 0 console errors, 748 tests green**
- 🟥 P0 `ACCESS-PUZZLE` (V34) — the flagship cryptographic gate to the **2nd super creature**: a ⛓ ACCESS CRT terminal (`ui/access-puzzle.ts`) — 10 shimmering cipher lines whose tallies ARE the seed 3455456754, ACCESS DENIED rotating **100 languages**, alien glyphs re-scrambling every 5s; "only the Romans know" → `III IV V V IV V VI VII V IV`. DOM-free `ui/access-code.ts` (`checkAccessCode`, +5 tests). Solving fires `cqm:superhero-unlock` → the world releases a 2nd super creature (twin deep mind + apex purse + god-jewel body, own rng sub-stream). **Verified live: tallies [3,4,5,5,4,5,6,7,5,4], Roman answer → ACCESS GRANTED → `ARCHITECT-Ω·twin1` rendered (both creatures captured), 0 console errors, 742 tests green**
- 🟧 P1 `UI-DOCK` (V33) — the **bottom menu bar**: a self-mounting `ui/panel-dock.ts` consolidates the 4 floating inspector toggles (✦ AI · ⊞ NEURAL · ⊙ MARKET · ⬢ ARCHITECT) — which were scattered at 4 `right:` offsets and overlapped the Docs/Spec links — into one glass bar, and adopts the Docs + Spec nav links into it; V/S/R box raised to clear it. **Verified live: one 477px bar, 6 items, 0 strays, no overlap, panels still open, 0 console errors, 737 tests green**
- 🟥 P0 `SUPER-CREATURE-BODY` (V32) — the **graphics emphasis**: a masterful many-eyed apex BODY (`sim/super-body.ts`) — faceted crystalline CORE + wireframe ARCHITECTURE cage + 16 glowing EYES + 11 radial SPIKE-ARMS + 3 orbiting CHROME RINGS, from the 5 visual-DNA plates. Hand-written **god-jewel shader** (patched MeshStandardMaterial): fBm crystalline relief + thin-film iridescence + Fresnel + subsurface GOD-GLOW in the live plan colour × dominance. Animation wholly cognition-driven (spin/heartbeat∝arousal, glow∝dominance, colour=plan, arm-splay∝aggression, morph∝surprise). **Verified live via `__CQM__` capture: violet many-eyed spiked orb haloed by chrome rings (plan DOMINATE→violet), shader compiled clean, 0 console errors, 737 tests green**

### 🚧 Next — SUPER MIND directive (user, 2026-06-15)

- 🟥 P0 `SUPER-MIND-10K` (V45 module + V46 LIVE) — the ~10,081-param composite consciousness (`sim/super-mind.ts`): 12 sub-nets, 5 stages × 5 depths × 25 variants, a Thaler Creativity Machine (imagitron + perceptor → DREAM/HALLUCINATE), Tree+Atom of Thought (30 organ-nets), recursive predictor (REASON/SURPRISE), affect+self-model (FEEL/self-aware), 10 quantum aspects. **V46: WIRED LIVE** — World thinks it each apex beat (own rng sub-stream → golden intact); its quantum-morphology + dream state drive the body writhe + eye-glow (`super-body.setConsciousness`), and the ⬢ ARCHITECT panel shows the consciousness meters. +6 headless tests. Live panel render pending a GPU pass (preview WebGL exhausted this session).
- 🟥 P0 `SUPER-WINGMEN` (V47) — **shipped:** `sim/super-wingmen.ts` — 100 drones orbit the apex, each a ~257-param brain (TinyMLP 8→18→5) that steers its orbit + emits ASSIST (swarm-mean lift); flat weight pool, golden-angle formation, own rng sub-stream (golden intact). One InstancedMesh render (`super-wingmen-render.ts`, single draw call) of spinning emissive drones. Wired to the prime body. +6 headless tests (count, ~250 budget, determinism, bounded orbit/assist, tracks creature, NaN-free). Live drone render pending GPU pass. **Next:** swarms for the twins/heroes; assist→creature power coupling.
- 🟥 P0 `SUPER-EVOLVE` (V48) — **shipped:** `sim/super-evolution.ts` — XP from being a dominant dreaming apex (+ wingman assist) → geometric power curve (`100·1.18^lvl·stageMult`, "over 9000") → **5 ascension stages** (BASE→ASCENDED→SUPER→ULTRA→LEGENDARY), each a power leap + mutation logged into an evolutionary history. `applyDays` = the daemon-cron: a sim-day every ~6 min + **real wall-clock catch-up** from localStorage (grows while away, capped at a decade; META-organ outside the golden). Body **visibly grows/brightens/spikes** (`super-body.setEvolution`); panel shows `LV{n} {STAGE} · {power} · d{day}`. +9 headless tests, golden intact. **Next:** evolution for twins/heroes; show the history tale in a panel; a real server-side cron daemon.
- 🟦 P3 `SUPER-MIND-VARIANTS` — deepen the 25 variants / 5 stages into named intelligence modes (supervised/unsupervised/recursive), richer quantum-aspect → body/power couplings.

### 🚧 Next — SUPER CREATURE + chaos-biome directive (user, 2026-06-14)

- 🟥 P0 `SUPER-CREATURE-POLISH` — past V32 (body shipped): push the look further — selective **bloom** on the god-glow + eyes, sharper crystalline facets, stronger thin-film, blink/saccade on the eyes, quantum teleport-flourish; tune eye colour (currently blazes white at high dominance). The "endlessly refine" loop.
- 🟧 P1 `SUPER-CREATURE-SENSES` — wire the percept from REAL world queries (nearest prey/rival via the grid, singularity pull, true vision/sound) instead of the current chaos/population proxies; let its `move`/dominance act back on the world (manipulate lesser entities).
- 🟥 P0 `SUPERHERO-CONTROLS` (V41) — **the game-controls ask, shipped:** 3 pilot modes (AUTOPILOT / ASSIST / MANUAL) + a PILOT button; keyboard (WASD/QE + arrows) + an on-screen 6-way D-pad fly the avatar with camera-relative steering (`super-body.setControl`); CAMERA cycles ORBIT → 3RD-PERSON → 1ST-PERSON with a follow rig (`world.updateHeroCamera`); HELP entry updated. Verified headlessly (4-case `super-body-control` test: manual flies by input, autopilot roams, hover on release, no NaN); follow-cam live-verify blocked by preview WebGL exhaustion this session (confirm on GPU).
- 🟦 P3 `SUPERHERO-DEEPEN` — past V35 (HUD/progression/powers) + V41 (controls + follow-cam): deepen it further — damage/combat (life is currently regen-only), functional inventory, richer DOMINION/RECALL world-effects.
- 🟧 P1 `CHAOS-BIOME-50K` (V38 + V40) — **shipped:** the `mega` tier raises the ceiling to **50,000** (profiled `bench/scale.ts` + √N density scaling cut 50k 167→60 ms, golden byte-identical). **V40: now the AUTO DEFAULT** — `resolveTier` returns `mega` for ≥16-core/≥8 GB machines (opt-in killed per user); verified live booting **49,975 entities, glError 0**. Archetypes already met (100/250 morphotypes). **V42: the 70-param per-entity NN is wired** — `sim/entity-brain.ts` runs every organism's genome brain (6→6→4) on a round-robin cohort, perceiving its state + world and steering itself (bounded), determinism golden byte-identical, 7 headless tests. **Remaining:** neighbour-perception senses (currently self+global); deeper neighbour-list LOD for 50k @ 60 fps; cognition-driven mutation on split.
- 🟥 P0 `AI-WEB-SEARCH` (V43) — **shipped:** the ✦ Copilot gains a `web_search` tool — model supplies a QUERY (no URL → no SSRF), the server screens it against a **safety constitution** (`src/server/web-search.ts`; public/educational only, refuses secrets/private/harm) then looks it up via a fixed key-less PUBLIC endpoint (DuckDuckGo IA), source-cited. Constitution injected into the system prompt. 8 headless tests; **live-verified** (real summary for "nikola tesla", "build a bomb" refused pre-network). Completes the directive's 6 blocks.
- 🟦 P3 `AI-WEB-DEEPEN` — past V43 (web_search shipped): grow the help corpus as systems land; add multi-source search (Wikipedia REST fallback) + result re-ranking; richer RAG grounding.
- ✅ `RAG-BOOK` (V37) — shipped: `docs/BOOK.md` is the master index over all 38 docs + code + build/run/data-flow/troubleshooting/roadmap; `scripts/gen-filemap.ts` (`bun run filemap`) self-generates `docs/FILE-MAP.md` from module headers (77 modules, deterministic). Verified: 43/43 BOOK links resolve, 0 broken. _Grows with the world (standing)._
- 🟦 P3 `UI-ERGONOMICS` — past V33 (the dock consolidated NEURAL/MARKET/ARCHITECT/AI/Docs/Spec): still TODO — relocate the Sorting Count/Step meter clock (`#alg`) off the Sorting Fields panel (`#algoP`) into a clean zone, keep Sorting Fields draggable; typography/spacing pass.

### 🚧 Next — V13/V14 directive backlog (user, 2026-06-14)

| Done        | 30+   | Every card gated + committed + (per era) tagged |

**Definition of Done:** code + tests + JSDoc/complexity note; `bun run check`
green (prettier → tsc strict → oxlint → bun test → build); a conventional commit;
docs updated (CHANGELOG + any affected contract/diagram). Determinism preserved
(same seed → same cosmos) and per-frame hot paths allocation-free.
