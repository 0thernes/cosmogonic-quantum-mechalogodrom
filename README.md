A procedural WebGL cosmic ecosystem — morphogenic organisms, Shoggoths,
puppet-master NPCs, atmospheric weather, a neural connectome, and quantum
diffusion. Built with **Bun + TypeScript + three.js 0.184 + Tailwind CSS 4 +
HTMX 2**, ported from a single 882-line HTML monolith into a strict,
deterministic, allocation-disciplined module graph.

Every run is reproducible from a seed. Every hot path is allocation-free.
Every magic number survived the port.

## Features

- **26 behavioral fields** driving up to 10,000 organisms: classic motion
  (drift, orbit, swarm, vortex, helix...), neighbor dynamics via a spatial
  hash (flock), and theory behaviors — Nash equilibria (`nash`), wealth
  exchange (`market`), subtyping attraction (`typemorph`), set membership
  (`setunion`), optimal-distance graphs (`graphseek`), and a Lorenz attractor
  (`lorenz`).
- **250 procedural morphotypes** (10 lore-named phyla × 25, ~1% wildcard
  outliers) over ~41 shared, never-disposed `BufferGeometry` instances;
  remorphing swaps geometry refs and rewrites the material with zero
  allocation.
- **25 sorting-field algorithms** with behaviorally honest names (BUBBLE
  FIELD, HEAP SIFT, BITONIC MESH, STOOGE DRIFT, TIM RUN MERGE, PATIENCE
  BUCKET...) that organize organisms through space in batched swap proposals
  per frame — each selectable from a picker panel with its own cue tone.
- **3 Shoggoths** — Lorenz-ish drifters with grid-queried tendrils that
  consume organisms and respawn corrupted ones.
- **3 puppet masters** — AETHON stokes chaos, SELENE shifts weather, KRONOS
  reshapes organisms — on their own timers, announced via toast.
- **6 weather states** (CLEAR, RAIN, STORM, AURORA, VOID, FOG) modulating
  wind, temperature (and thus lifespan), fog density, and exposure.
- **Quantum cloud** of 3,500–8,000 particles with wavefunction wobble,
  collapse, and respawn; **neural connectome** of up to 2,200–6,000 links with
  partial GPU uploads.
- **6 procedural Web Audio songs** + 8 synthesized SFX — no audio assets, just
  oscillators.
- **Deterministic seeded RNG** (`mulberry32`) injected everywhere; the global
  random number generator is banned in sim logic.
- **HTMX-polled audit trail**, versioned `localStorage` persistence,
  device-adaptive quality profile, glassmorphic Tailwind UI with canvas
  sparklines.

### Quantum Wildbeyond (0.2.0)

Seven systems added under [docs/PHILOSOPHY.md](./docs/PHILOSOPHY.md) — real
math under every effect, and every system reads from AND writes to another:

- **Quantum register** — a pure-TS 5-qubit statevector (no simulator dep;
  see [ADR 0005](./docs/adr/0005-math-stack-selection.md)). Puppet masters
  apply signature gate sequences, sort swaps apply CNOTs, and the register
  answers back: Born-rule probabilities recolor the quantum cloud, entropy is
  telemetry, measurement collapses implode the cloud locally.
- **Reaction-diffusion ground** — a genuine Gray-Scott field (128², CPU
  ping-pong) as the ground's emissive map; weather tunes feed/kill/diffusion
  and entity deaths scar the pattern.
- **Graph mind** — the connectome mirrored into a
  [graphology](https://graphology.github.io) graph; seeded Louvain communities
  paint links in an 8-hue tribe palette and rewrite entities' set-theory
  groups; PageRank crowns the top-20 with an emissive boost.
- **Constellations + lore** — a d3-delaunay Voronoi sky-web over the 24
  monolith/diorama sites, with every sector/tribe/omen name derived from
  sha256 digests of the seed (@noble/hashes): same seed, same mythology.
- **Audio analysis** — an AnalyserNode tap turns the synthesized music back
  into light (bass → the six-lamp rig, treble → constellations, level → cloud
  breathing), every coupling capped at 0.35 so silence looks exactly like v1.
- **Analytics + omens** — rolling-window regression (simple-statistics) puts a
  population trend in the telemetry; z-score anomalies emit lore-named omens
  into the audit trail.
- **Lab artifact** — a self-contained seeded p5.js "collapse field" at
  [/lab](http://localhost:3000/lab) (`lab/quantum-wildbeyond.html`).

### PANTHEON (0.3.0)

The arena grows 5× and the ecosystem becomes a civilization
(`docs/MODULE-CONTRACTS.md` §CONTRACTS V3):

- **10,000 entities** on the ultra tier through InstancedMesh pools — ≤80
  draw calls for the whole population, per-instance color/emissive/alpha,
  with a four-rung quality ladder (phone 650 / laptop 2,000 / desktop 5,000 /
  ultra 10,000) resolved once at boot.
- **10 creature phyla**, lore-named at mint, each a template distribution
  (hue band, geometry family, behavior pool, size/speed ranges, home wedge)
  — plus seeded wildcard OUTLIERS with impossible palettes, blended behavior
  pairs and ×3 parameter excursions.
- **10 TITANS** — colossal non-human intelligences patrolling their phyla's
  wedges, each running an {energy, matter, entropy} economy: they harvest
  organisms, metabolize, witness quantum collapses, bathe in the
  reaction-diffusion pattern, pay upkeep, and dump entropy as ground scars.
  Diplomacy is a staggered iterated prisoner's dilemma over all 45 pairs
  (tit-for-tat, grim trigger, Pavlov, always-defect, generous TFT);
  defection-heavy windows become WARS with territory strikes, loot and
  conscription; bankruptcy mutates strategy by replicator dynamics. Payoffs
  flow through the real energy ledger — game theory with consequences.
- **Observatory** — four live canvas charts: stacked phylum populations,
  titan wealth polylines with war markers, a 10×10 war-matrix heat grid, and
  rdEnergy/qEntropy/trend timelines.
- **Full-device UI** — one responsive overlay grid: desktop columns, phone
  sheet stacks, foldable hinge-safe rails, 43″-TV 10-foot mode; touch
  controls v2 (drag joystick + look pad + radial action wheel with an
  apocalypse long-press) with ≤30 ms haptics.
- **Pantheon rescore** — four new QUANTUM-tier dark songs (VOIDCROWN, BLACK
  MERIDIAN, ELDER ENGINE, LAST THEOREM) around the untouched QUANTUM.

### 0.2.1 — the audit wave

Twenty-one adversarially confirmed audit findings landed as a patch release:
the Lorenz NaN blow-up is sealed, the audio exposure feedback is gone (bass
now shimmers the six-lamp rig instead), the color pipeline reproduces the
legacy r128 palette exactly (LinearSRGB output + calibrated light units), the
legacy control colors are restored, the canvas gains **mouse-look and wheel
zoom**, and the server, persistence store, and `/lab` CDN script are hardened
(body caps + HTML escaping, field-validated state, SRI). Details in
[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

### XENOGENESIS (0.4.0)

The cosmos becomes an alien, immortal, sentient biome (CONTRACTS V4):

- **Alien atmosphere** — an inverted sky dome with a non-Earth baked gradient
  (oxblood horizon → violet zenith → teal counter-glow) recoloring with weather
  and chaos, wind-advected haze ribbons breathing with the music's bass, a
  tier-scaled particulate air volume, and an aurora curtain brightening with
  quantum entropy.
- **In-scene 3D analytics** — a holographic instrument panel floating above the
  arena: ten phylum-population towers, ten titan economy obelisks (height =
  matter, glow = energy, hue = war state), and a live war-network of up to 45
  segments.
- **Four-page Observatory** — overview, variance (mean±σ bands, histogram,
  Shannon diversity, qEntropy–trend phase), ecology (per-phylum
  small-multiples, birth/death flux, titan phase portraits), and conflict (war
  intensity, per-titan resources, a biome **sentience index** gauge).
- Touch consolidated onto `InputSystem`: look pad, radial action wheel,
  long-press apocalypse, guarded haptics.

### RESONANCE (0.5.0) + ATELIER (0.6.x)

Two direct user-feedback passes (CONTRACTS V5/V6):

- **25 sorting fields** (was 20) with batched, _visible_ swaps — the active
  algorithm organizes the world with a shimmer light show, a live swap-count
  HUD, and (0.6.1) a unique cue tone per field; a collapsible picker panel
  lists all 25 with a live sorted-fraction progress bar.
- **Soundtrack raised to the QUANTUM tier** — VOIDCROWN, ELDER ENGINE, and LAST
  THEOREM rebuilt with 4-note voicings and 16-step evolving melodies, plus the
  new finale **STARKILLER REQUIEM** (6 songs total); the synthesis gains
  sub-bass, a third detuned voice, arpeggiation, and filter-LFO swells.
- **Ultra tier fills 10,000 entities** via per-frame neighbor-query throttles
  (theory-behavior stagger, half-rate flock, `ULTRA_GRID_CELL`, connectome
  cadence ladder) — calibration history in
  [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](./docs/BENCHMARKS.md).
- **Observatory legibility** — every chart gains an in-canvas title band,
  axis ticks, bold strokes, and overlap-free layouts; canvases are taller and
  the panel wider on desktop/TV.
- **Mobile ergonomics** — panels become edge-docked slide-out sheets
  (TEL/CTL/OBS/AUD handles) over an unobstructed world; **pinch-to-zoom**
  (0.6.1) joins the joystick, look pad, and radial wheel.
- **Four-page Lab** at `/lab` and a GitHub-Pages-style **architecture report**
  at `/docs` with explicit ERD / ERM / ERP sections.

### XENOCATACLYSM (0.7.0)

The third user-feedback decree — make the world visibly come alive
(`docs/MODULE-CONTRACTS.md` §CONTRACTS V7):

- **100 distinct sound effects** (was 8) — a procedurally generated, seeded
  palette across twelve timbral families plus a 25-slot cue band (one engineered
  voice per sorting field), voiced by one data-driven synth; repeating the same
  action never sounds identical.
- **A living algorithm picker** — every sorting-field row reads in its own
  colour with its own glyph and reactive touch states, selecting one ignites the
  population, plus **RUN ALL** (every field at once) and **AUTO** (march through
  all 25) modes.
- **Five render modes** — SOLID, WIRE, GHOST (x-ray), NEON (self-glow), CHROME
  (mirror), cycled from the toolbar over both the per-mesh and instanced paths.
- **Cosmological singularities** on the chaos control — ENTROPY, BLACK HOLE
  (r⁻² pull + consuming event horizon + accretion disk), WHITE HOLE (ejection),
  GREY HOLE (absorb↔emit), STRANGE STAR (quark-matter conversion front), each a
  deterministic force-field with a self-built, auto-expiring rig.
- **Dramatic weather** — STORM gales with deterministic lightning, a −60 °C VOID
  deep freeze, a luminous AURORA, a pale FOG whiteout — each unmistakable.
- **SIMULATION N(1) / N(2)** — toggle between GENESIS (the shipped cosmos) and
  BREAK FREE (the nightmare: raised chaos floor, a lurid inverted sky, rebranded
  title); persisted across sessions.

### HARDENING (0.8.0)

A professional-grade pass — no new cosmology, all rigor:

- **Binary heap + bounded top-K** ([src/math/heap.ts](./src/math/heap.ts)) — a
  generic `BinaryHeap<T>` (O(log n) push/pop) and `selectTopK` (O(n log k) /
  O(k) space); PageRank halo selection moved from O(V log V) to O(V log K) over
  V ≤ 10,000, byte-identical tie-break preserved.
- **Security + governance automation** — CodeQL (`security-extended`, push/PR +
  weekly), Dependabot, a tagged-release CD workflow, CODEOWNERS, a PR template,
  and bug/feature issue templates.
- **Data-model + process docs** — [docs/ERM.md](./docs/ERM.md) (conceptual model
  - cardinality + cross-system write-back matrix) and [docs/ERP.md](./docs/ERP.md)
    (boot, frame pipeline, cadence schedule, lifecycles) joining the existing
    [docs/ERD.md](./docs/ERD.md).
- **[docs/500-POINT-INSPECTION.md](./docs/500-POINT-INSPECTION.md)** — a standing
  audit of 25 sections × 20 checkpoints, each with a verdict and concrete
  evidence.
- **Health-endpoint version** now derived from `package.json` at startup so it
  can never drift.

### AGImAGNOSIS (0.9.0)

The world gains minds — pre-transformer game / A-Life AI, reproduction across
generations, and a read-only Copilot (`docs/MODULE-CONTRACTS.md` §V9):

- **Deterministic classical-AI kernel** ([src/sim/ai/brains.ts](./src/sim/ai/brains.ts))
  — the pre-2016 toolbox as pure, seeded, allocation-free primitives: utility /
  softmax scoring, a fixed-weight perceptron (`TinyMLP`), a `MarkovChain`, an
  `fsmStep` FSM, a F.E.A.R.-style `goapPlan`, and a bounded `MemoryRing`
  blackboard.
- **Digital genome + lineage** ([src/sim/genome.ts](./src/sim/genome.ts),
  [src/sim/lineage.ts](./src/sim/lineage.ts)) — a heritable gene vector decoding
  to traits + a `TinyMLP` brain, with seeded crossover/mutation/breed and a
  bounded parent→offspring kinship graph (generations, ancestry, relatedness).
- **Eight faction archetypes** ([src/sim/factions.ts](./src/sim/factions.ts)) —
  Watchers / Weavers / Wardens / Heralds / Leviathans / SwarmMinds / Oracles /
  Devourers, each thinking with a different brain technique. Plus **Leviathans**
  ([src/sim/leviathans.ts](./src/sim/leviathans.ts)), a fourth order of colossi,
  and **NHI** autonomous mini-AIs.
- **Environment artifact field** ([src/sim/artifacts.ts](./src/sim/artifacts.ts))
  — persistent relics (a scar per death, a relic per summoned singularity, motes)
  through one pooled InstancedMesh; visual-only and determinism-safe.
- **Free-LLM Copilot side-chat** ([src/server/copilot.ts](./src/server/copilot.ts),
  [src/server/ai-sandbox.ts](./src/server/ai-sandbox.ts),
  [src/ui/copilot.ts](./src/ui/copilot.ts)) — a read-only AI you chat with about
  the repo and the world, over a pluggable OpenAI-compatible provider (keyless
  Pollinations default; OpenRouter / Groq / `freellmapi` via env) behind a
  default-deny sandbox that can READ files and RUN read-only commands but never
  change code. Provider reference: [docs/COPILOT-PROVIDERS.md](./docs/COPILOT-PROVIDERS.md)
  · in-world minds: [docs/AI-SUBSYSTEM.md](./docs/AI-SUBSYSTEM.md).
- **Five cinematic cameras** (follow / chase / cinematic / vortex / titan) with
  **TIME** (timeScale) and **SPACE** (FOV dilation) controls; **render modes now
  alter dynamics** (`solid` stays the exact determinism identity); singularities
  now pull titans/shoggoths/leviathans; chaos is leveled and bipolar.

### The Living Era (post-0.9.0 · V10–V64)

Since 0.9.0 the cosmos has grown continuously — fifty-plus increments logged in
the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) `[Unreleased]` section, each shipped behind the
full gate with same-seed determinism preserved. The major arcs:

- **A deeper economy & society (V13–V23)** — two currencies (AURUM ☉ / UMBRA ☾)
  and two commodities over a game-theoretic clearing market, with cartels,
  arbitrage, sanctions, a black market, and Vickrey windfall auctions; titan
  diplomacy, Shoggoth boldness and Puppeteer meddling all driven by live wealth,
  surfaced in a self-building ⊙ MARKET panel.
- **Creature cognition (V24–V29)** — Shoggoths perceive · remember · flee · hunt,
  Puppeteers scheme, the outmatched deceive, and peers bargain, trade & ally — a
  pure `creatureDrive` kernel closing the cognition↔economy loop.
- **The native engine (V18, V28)** — a C++20 / OpenGL SDF ray-marcher with **Jolt
  Physics** rigid bodies and on-impact volume-conserving **fracture**, rendered on
  an RTX 5070 Ti ([`native/`](./native),
  [ADR-0007](./docs/adr/0007-native-cpp-engine-and-live-physics.md)).
- **The SUPER CREATURE (V31–V48)** — an always-active apex being: a ~1,444-param
  deep mind grown into a ~10,000-param composite consciousness (Thaler creativity
  machine, Tree/Atom-of-Thought, GOAP), a many-eyed god-jewel **body**, a 100-drone
  **wingman swarm**, **self-evolution** (XP → five ascension stages + a wall-clock
  daemon-cron), an **ACCESS PUZZLE** gate, **SUPERHERO** player mode (pilot it in
  1st/3rd person), and an offline-AI **diagnostics + recovery** pipeline.
- **Scale & per-entity minds (V38–V42)** — the `mega` tier lifts the ceiling to
  **50,000 organisms** (√N density scaling) with a 70-param neural controller
  running on every entity.
- **In-world AI (V36–V43)** — **HELP ME NOW** (a repo-grounded answer panel),
  **THE BOOK** (the navigable RAG repo index), and an in-world **web search**
  under a refuse-by-default safety constitution.
- **The HUD + cosmos directive (V56–V64)** — the **CENTER HUD** (six panels → one
  cyclable pop-up), singularities that **warp space-time** (time dilation +
  redshift) behind a full-screen **gravitational-lens** post-FX, a self-animating
  **NEURAL observatory**, **CHAOS MODE** (a toggled Lorenz quantum storm —
  tunnelling / entanglement / superposition that disturbs weather, economy and
  the sorting fields), **leveling to 100** with a godlike power every ten levels
  and an **ASCENSION monolith temple**, and singularities that stir world chaos.

Work on this codebase is governed by the three **master files** in
[masters/](./masters/) — Executor, Architect, Physicist — bound by
[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) and the binding per-module spec in
[docs/MODULE-CONTRACTS.md](./docs/MODULE-CONTRACTS.md).
